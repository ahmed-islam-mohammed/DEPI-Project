Completed capstone project on building a data warehouse and developing ETL pipelines

This repository includes all the files related to my graduation project, which was part of the Digital Egypt Pioneers scholarship.

If you would like to view the files in a more structured and organized manner, you can access the Google Drive link I will provide. The content is arranged there more effectively for a better experience.

Additionally, the PowerPoint presentation for my section of the project has been compressed due to its large size. Please download and extract the file to view the presentation properly.

The repository also contains explanatory videos demonstrating some of the project's implementation mechanisms for better clarity.
